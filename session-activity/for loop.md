for...of is designed for iterating over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
Iteration Target:

for...in iterates over the keys (property names) of an object.
for...of iterates over the values of an iterable object.
Use Case:

Use for...in when you need to iterate over object properties.
Use for...of when you need to iterate over the values in an iterable.
Inherited Properties:

for...in iterates over all enumerable properties, including those inherited through the prototype chain.
for...of only iterates over the values of the iterable, not including inherited properties.
